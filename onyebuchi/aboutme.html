    <h1 id="About">About</h1>
    <p class="para">My name is Onyebuchi Nwoye. I was born into a polygamous family of eleven children, in Umuahia, Abia State. 
       I am a native of Ifite Awkuzu, Oyi LGA in Anambra State. My mom was the second wife of late, Mr. E.E Nwoye,
       whom she had six children with. My father died on the 16th March, 2016, I am the second child and the only 
       son of my mom. I attended Master's Vessel Classical Academy, Umuahia, for my primary school and Resonance
       Model Schools, Umuahia, for my secondary school. I wrote my Senior Secondary School Examination (SSCE) 
       May/June 2012. I couldn't further my education after my SSCE because of family issues, at that time, my 
       father was on the sickbed, his business was already down, my mom purchased a new shop which was demolished
       in 2013 by the Abia State Government within a year after she purchased it. She had to start up again, this 
       time around, I was with her to assist and manage the business. As time goes by, I was able to get a loan 
       from a micro finance bank which I used to start up my own business. Growing up in a business family, I 
       learnt a lot of business skills from my parents, but I've always had passion for technology, I started 
       making plans of having a career as a web designer and developer, because I know the importance of technology 
       in the world and how it keeps growing day by day. To make this come true, I had to make a move, I moved to 
       Lagos for the first time on the 21st August, 2022, where I currently live with my sisters at #13 Olufemi Street,
       off Ojuelegba Road in Surulere, on a quest to learn web design and development, I know how essential web
       developers are in companies and how there are wide range of opportunities in the technology industry. A week and 
       some days after my arrival, through my sister, I learnt about an on going application in Web Development Program 
       sponsored by the Industrial Training Fund through Skills 4 Prosperity - Nigeria(S4P - N) and implemented
       by NerdzFactory Company, I had to apply for the program and went for the physical screening test. On
       6th September, 2022, I got an email that I've been admitted for the training. At the moment, I'm self employed
       cause I run my business.</p>
    <p class="para">In web design and development, I would like to be a full stack web developer. I would like to create websites that
       are visually appealing, user friendly and accessible to a wide range of device. I would ensure my websites are 
       properly coded and functional. I would like to handle big projects by taking them one step at a time and paying 
       close attention to the details.</p>

       to pay for living a dream.</q><cite>Peter McWilliams</cite></p>
