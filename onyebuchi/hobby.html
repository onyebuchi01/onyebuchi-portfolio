    <p class="para">My hobby is football, I love everything about football. I love watching it and I play it too, it 
       has always been my hobby since I was a child. I remember school days, how I will stay back after
       school dismissal, to play football with my friends in the school field.<br>Honestly, football makes me happy.
       Watching my favorite team win their match is a thing of joy. Playing football increases my confidence and 
       self-esteem.<br>I have traveled to Anambra state and Aba to play football for my team. I led my school team 
       as a captain in a football competition in Umuahia, I don't think I will experience that again.</p>
